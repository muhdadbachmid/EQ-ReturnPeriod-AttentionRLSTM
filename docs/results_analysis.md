# Results and Analysis

## Model Training and Optimization

The Residual LSTM with Attention Mechanism was trained using the Adam optimizer, which was selected for its adaptive learning rate properties and efficiency in handling large-scale datasets. The learning rate was set to **0.001**, striking a balance between convergence speed and model stability. To minimize prediction deviations, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** was chosen as the loss function, as it effectively penalizes larger errors, ensuring precise model learning.

To prevent overfitting, **EarlyStopping** was implemented with the following parameters:
- **Monitor:** Validation loss (`val_loss`)
- **Patience:** 15 epochs (training stops if no improvement is observed for 15 consecutive epochs)
- **Restore Best Weights:** `True` (ensures retention of the best weight configuration corresponding to the lowest validation loss)
- **Min Delta:** `1e-4` (ensures meaningful validation loss improvements before stopping training)

The model was trained for **150 epochs** with a batch size of **32**, ensuring an optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and gradient stability. A **20% validation split** was used to evaluate model generalization during training, allowing real-time monitoring of predictive performance.

## Model Evaluation

Upon training completion, the model was evaluated on both the **training** and **test datasets** to assess predictive accuracy. The generated predictions were compared against actual values using multiple evaluation metrics:

| Metric          | Training Data | Test Data |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Train Loss** | 0.0042       | 0.0045    |
| **MAE**        | 0.0698       | 0.0717    |
| **RMSE**       | 0.0947       | 0.0951    |
| **Huber Loss** | 0.0045       | 0.0045    |

The **small discrepancy** between training MAE (0.0698) and test MAE (0.0717) confirmed that overfitting was effectively mitigated, ensuring strong **generalization capabilities**. The **Huber Loss remained consistent (0.0045)** across both datasets, demonstrating robustness in handling outliers—an essential characteristic when working with seismic data, which often includes extreme values.

## Performance Analysis

The Residual LSTM with Attention Mechanism effectively captured complex **temporal dependencies** within earthquake recurrence data. The integration of **attention mechanisms** allowed the model to selectively focus on significant temporal patterns, thereby improving interpretability and optimizing predictive accuracy.

Key observations from model performance:
- **Low RMSE values** (0.0947 for training and 0.0951 for testing) indicate well-controlled prediction errors, affirming the effectiveness of the model.
- **Attention Mechanism Integration** enhanced the model’s ability to prioritize critical time-series patterns, improving long-term predictions.
- **Huber Loss Stability** ensured resilience against anomalous seismic events, preventing large fluctuations in prediction accuracy due to data outliers.

## Conclusion

The study results demonstrate that the **Residual LSTM with Attention Mechanism** is highly effective in predicting **earthquake recurrence intervals**. The model successfully minimizes errors while maintaining resilience against extreme values, making it highly suitable for seismic forecasting applications. The integration of deep learning techniques has shown **significant potential in improving earthquake risk assessment and mitigation strategies**, offering a reliable data-driven approach for seismic event prediction.

Future enhancements may include:
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for further performance improvements.
- Expanding the dataset to incorporate additional seismic features for better generalization.
- Exploring ensemble models to compare prediction accuracy across different deep learning architectures.

These findings underscore the potential of deep learning in seismic research, highlighting its role in **enhancing early warning systems and disaster preparedness strategies**.
