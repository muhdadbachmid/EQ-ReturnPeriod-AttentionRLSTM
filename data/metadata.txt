# Metadata for Earthquake Dataset (USGS)

This file provides descriptions of the columns in the earthquake dataset sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Each variable is explained in detail to facilitate understanding and analysis.

## Column Descriptions:

1. **time**: Date and time of the earthquake occurrence in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This is crucial for temporal analysis, such as identifying trends or time patterns.

2. **latitude**: Latitude coordinate of the earthquake epicenter in degrees. Used together with longitude to determine the geographical location of the earthquake.

3. **longitude**: Longitude coordinate of the earthquake epicenter in degrees. Used in conjunction with latitude for location determination.

4. **depth**: Depth of the earthquake's epicenter measured from the Earth's surface, in kilometers. The depth can affect the earthquake’s impact on the surface.

5. **mag**: Earthquake magnitude, representing the strength of the earthquake. This is measured using different methods and is crucial for determining the scale of the earthquake’s impact.

6. **magType**: Type of magnitude measurement, such as mb (Body wave magnitude), ms (Surface wave magnitude), mw (Moment magnitude), etc. Different types of magnitude are used for earthquakes with different characteristics.

7. **nst**: Number of seismic stations that detected the earthquake. A higher number of stations can improve data accuracy.

8. **gap**: The azimuthal gap (in degrees) between the two farthest seismic stations detecting the earthquake. A large gap may indicate higher uncertainty in locating the earthquake.

9. **dmin**: Minimum horizontal distance from the earthquake epicenter to the nearest seismic station, measured in degrees. This helps determine location accuracy.

10. **rms**: Root Mean Square of the residuals (difference between observed and predicted arrival times of seismic waves). This value indicates the accuracy of the seismic model in estimating the earthquake’s location.

11. **net**: Seismic network that reported the earthquake data, e.g., "us" for USGS. This helps track data sources and measurement methodologies.

12. **id**: Unique identifier for each earthquake event. Useful for identifying and referencing specific earthquakes in data analysis.

13. **updated**: Timestamp of the last update to the data. This ensures that the dataset used is the most accurate and up-to-date.

14. **place**: Description of the nearest location to the earthquake epicenter, such as a city or landmark. This provides a more intuitive geographical context.

15. **type**: Type of seismic event, such as "earthquake" or "quarry blast." Helps in categorizing different seismic activities.

16. **horizontalError**: Estimated error in the horizontal location of the earthquake epicenter, in kilometers. This indicates uncertainty in geographical positioning.

17. **depthError**: Estimated error in the depth of the earthquake epicenter, in kilometers. This reflects the uncertainty in depth estimation.

18. **magError**: Estimated error in the earthquake magnitude. Indicates uncertainty in assessing the earthquake's strength.

19. **magNst**: Number of magnitude measurements taken. This can indicate the reliability of the magnitude estimation.

20. **status**: Data review status, such as "reviewed" (manually verified) or "automatic" (automatically generated and not yet reviewed). This helps assess data reliability.

21. **locationSource**: Source that determined the earthquake’s location. Important for tracking methodologies and reliability of location determination.

22. **magSource**: Source that determined the earthquake’s magnitude. Knowing the measurement source helps assess data consistency and accuracy.
